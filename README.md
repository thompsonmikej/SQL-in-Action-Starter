# SQL_in_Action_Starter

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A hands-on lab for practicing SQL queries and relational data modeling. This project provides exercises to help you extract, filter, and analyze information from a database using SQL, guided by entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs).

---

## Description

Learn to write and run essential SQL queries for real-world database scenarios. Tasks include extracting specific records, joining tables, filtering results, and visualizing data relationships with ERDs.

---

## Features

- Write SQL SELECT queries to extract and analyze data  
- Filter records using WHERE clauses and sort results  
- Practice JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables  
- Reference ERDs to understand and design database structure  
- Apply basic aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)

---

## Technologies Used

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- ERD diagrams

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/SQL_in_Action_Starter.git
cd SQL_in_Action_Starter
text

2. **Set up your SQL environment:**
- Install your preferred RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Import the provided `.sql` schema/scripts to create tables and load sample data

3. **Use your database client or command line tool to run queries:**
- Connect to the sample database
- Open the exercises or query files to begin practicing

---

## Usage

- Review the provided ERD diagrams to understand table relationships
- Solve each lab exercise by writing and executing SQL queries
- Experiment with modifying queries to answer new business questions or analyze trends
- Extend the schema and data as needed to deepen your learning

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Developed proficiency in SQL for querying, filtering, and aggregating relational data  
- Learned to interpret and utilize ERDs for effective database design  
- Built confidence in using SQL across different relational database systems

---

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced exercises (subqueries, group by, window functions)
- Include automated tests or query validation scripts
- Expand to data visualization or reporting tasks using SQL results
